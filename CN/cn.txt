# How the Internet Works – Step-by-Step:

1. URL Entered in Browser
2. Local Cache Checks
3. DNS Lookup (If Not Found in Cache)
4. IP Address Sent Back to Browser
5. Establishing a Connection (TCP/IP & Handshake)
6. IP Routing & Hops
7. Destination Server Reached
8. Server Response Sent Back
9. Browser Renders the Webpage
10. Securing Connection

# DNS Resolution

- DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses
- DNS queries uses UDP protocol for faster communication.
  - If TCP was used, we'd have spent a lot time in handshakes and Acknowledgements.
- IP address is usually cached by browsers and kernel to avoid resolution lookups.
- If not found in cache, then only the machine queries the DNS resolver.

- Resolution process:
  - DNS Resolver
    - First point of contact for DNS queries provided by ISP or third-party services
    - Checks local cache before querying other servers

  - Root Servers
    - First step in domain resolution
    - Directly queries the appropriate TLD servers
    - Global distribution for reliability
  
  - TLD (Top-Level Domain) Servers
    - Manage .com, .org, .edu, etc.
    - Directs to authoritative name servers
    - Store information about domain registrations
  
  - Authoritative DNS Servers
    - Store actual IP addresses for domains
    - Final authority for domain information

  - This retrived IP address gets cached at each stage in upstream to avoid unnecessary lookups.

  - DNS Resolver <--> Root Servers <--> TLD Servers <--> Authoritative Server

# Transmission Control Protocol:

[1] TCP establishes a three way handshake between peers to exchange their initial sequence numbers
    to synchronize future communications.

[2] TCP caches everything sent for a Retransmission 
    - If No ACK is received, segment is resent.

[3] Initially, TCP sent an ACK for every packets received.
    - So for 100 packets, 100 ACK has to be sent. 
      This doubles the amount of packets need to be sent on wire.
    - To reduce this Burden, An optimization is added to TCP, named as 'Delayed Acknowledgements'
    - Delayed ACK: Send ACK every other segment
      eg: A Single cumulative ACK for SEQ 1001 and 1200 (200 bytes) is sent at once 

[4] [FLOW CONTROL]: TCP Window size defines how much unacknowledged packets can a peer send before waiting for ACK. 
    - These packets are called as 'bytes in flight'.
    - A window size is how many bytes can exist on the wire in the path between A and B.
    - It is a field in TCP header and is sent in each ACK segment.
    - A window size is set by the receiver and can be dynamically updated through connection.

[5] TCP is bidirectional. Both Peers can send data to each other.
    - Both Peers have SEQ# to track bytes sent.
    - Both Peers have ACK# to track bytes received.
    - Initial Sequence Numbers (ISN) are randomly chosen by sender. 
      These ISNs must be shared during the handshake

[6] TCP has two options to close the connection:
    
    a. Graceful closure: (2 way) (everything went well)
      - Either of A or B can use the [FIN] flag to indicate that they want to close the connection.
      - Connection would not close immediately and would wait for
        any pending data to receive or an closure ACK.
      - With this type of closure, the FIN flag has to be acknowledged with sender's SEQ+1 from both A and B.
    
    b. Ungraceful closure: (1 way) (Something went wrong)
      - One way RST (reset) flag.
      - Either peer can send to the [RST] flag to immediately close the connection.
      - None waits for acknowledgement, cause once the RST flag is set
        sender deletes every information regarding receiver. 

- TCP ensures reliability, flow control and error handling during transmission.

# OSI Reference Model

Layer 1: (Bits)
    - Computer Data exists in form of bits 0s and 1s.
    - Something has to transport these bits between hosts.
    - L1 Technologies: Ethernet Cables, WIFI radio waves, Repeater, Hub

Layer 2: (Frames)
    - Interacts with Physical layer to PUT and RETRIEVE bits from wire.
    - L2 Technologies: Switches, Network Interface Cards (NIC), WIFI Access Cards (WAC) 
    - Addressing Scheme: MAC addresses
        - 48 Bits, represented as 12 hex digits
        - eg: 94-65-9C-3B-8A-E5 (windows), 94.65.9C.3B.8A.E5 (linux), 9465.9C3B.8AE5 (cisco devices)
    - L2 devices like switches uses a MAC address table (CAM table) to find the destination MAC address.

Layer 3: (Packets)
    - Ensure the bits reach the host machine after hops.
    - L3 Technologies: Routers, Hosts, anything with an IP address
    - Addressing Scheme: IP addresses
        - 32 bits (IPv4), represented as 4 octets (each 0 to 255)
    - Uses Address Resolution Protocol [ARP] to link a L3 address (IP) to L2 address (MAC)

Layer 4: (Segments)
    - Distinguish data stream to ensure right programs(services) receives the right packets.
    - Addressing Scheme:
        - Port Numbers : 0 to 65535 for TCP and UDP each.
        - servers listens for requests on predefined ports [HTTP(TCP): 80, HTTPS(TCP): 443, UDP: 6667]
        - clients select random port for each connection and receives response on the same port.
        - eg:  TCP  1.1.1.1:9999 (browser)  <-->  2.2.2.2:80 (HTTP server)
Layer 5:
    - Distinguishes between User sessions. It identifies a user independent of L4, L3 or L2 addresses.
    - Layer 5 helps user persist his information when the L2 to L4 info changes (i.e., his network changes)
    - HTTP Cookie is an example of a Layer 5 session. 
        - HTTP servers use a unique Cookie to identify same user independent of his L2 to L4 addresses. 
Layer 6:
    - Determines how to interpret 1s and 0s.
    - Everything up till layer 5 is a continuous stream of bits. Layer 6 determines the fragmentation scheme of bits.
    - This fragmentation will help make meaning sequences out of huge random streams.
    - eg: consider the stream  : 00010010101010011101010111101001110001001010101001110101011110100000
        - base64 (6 bits)      : 000100 101010 100110 ...     => R O V ...
        - hexadecimal (4 bits) : 0001 0010 1010 0100 1110 ... => 4 7 4 5 5 ...
        - 32 Bit numbers       : 00010010101010011101010111101001 00010010101010011101010111101001 => 2 huge numbers
        - HTTP eASCII (8 bits) : 00010010 101011001 11010101 ... => GET ...
Layer 7:
    - Determines what to do with Layer 6 interpreted characters.
    - Application commands.
    - example, Layer 7 will interpret this extended ASCII byte sequence:
        10100011 101000101 01010100 00100000 00101000 as an HTTP/1.1 'GET /' request
    - [PROTOCOLS like TCP, UDP, FTP, etc implement L5, L6 and L7 independently]

------------------------------------------------------------------

# HTTP/HTTPs

- HTTP is an Application Layer (OSI layer 7) built on top of TCP.
- HTTP allows us to share documents (usually markups, stylesheets and js files) across internet. 
- HTTP features request-response model and provides several HTTP Request Methods and Response Status Codes. 

- HTTP Request Methods:
  - GET: Retrieve data
  - POST: Send data to server
  - PUT: Update existing resource
  - DELETE: Remove resource
  - PATCH: Partial resource update
  - HEAD: Get headers only
  - OPTIONS: Show supported methods

- Response Status Codes:
  - 1xx: Informational responses
  - 2xx: Success responses
    - 200: OK
    - 201: Created
  - 3xx: Redirection
    - 301: Moved permanently
    - 302: Found (temporary redirect)
  - 4xx: Client errors
    - 400: Bad request
    - 401: Unauthorized
    - 403: Forbidden
    - 404: Not found
  - 5xx: Server errors
    - 500: Internal server error
    - 503: Service unavailable

- HTTPS is an extension of HTTP that adds encryption for secure communication over computer networks.
- It uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols for encryption.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- SSL/TLS Handshake:

  - Initial Connection Phase (Top section):
    - Server sends its certificate containing its public key
    - Client verifies server identity using this public key
    - This phase uses asymmetric encryption for security

  - Session Key Generation (Middle section):
    - Client generates a random session key
    - Encrypts it using server's public key
    - Only server can decrypt it using its private key
 
  - Secure Communication Phase (Bottom section):
    - Both parties switch to symmetric encryption
    - Uses the shared session key for all subsequent communication
    - Much faster than asymmetric encryption for bulk data transfer


- Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption:
 
  - Asymmetric (Public Key) Cryptography:
    - During the TLS handshake, asymmetric cryptography is used. 
    - In this phase, the server (and sometimes the client) uses a public/private key pair to exchange information securely. 
    - Typically, the server sends its certificate (which contains its public key) so that the client can verify its identity 
      and establish a secure connection.
    - The asymmetric part is primarily used during the handshake for authentication and to agree on a shared secret.

  - Symmetric Cryptography:
    - After the handshake, both parties use a shared secret key (derived during the handshake) 
      for encrypting and decrypting the data. This is much faster and is used for the bulk of the communication.
    - While symmetric encryption is used to secure the data transfer, the initial key exchange relies on asymmetric methods.

Delay in Computer Communication

- Types of Delays in Computer Communication:
  - Transmission Delay (store-and-forward delay) :
    - The amount of time required to push all the packet's bits into the wire. 
    - In other words, this is the delay caused by the data-rate of the link. 
    - Transmission delay is a function of the packet's length.
    - This delay is proportional to the packet's length in bits.
    - D_T = N / R  seconds
      - where:
        - N is the number of bits;
        - R is the rate of transmission (say, in bits per second).
    - Most packet switched networks use store-and-forward transmission at the input of the link. 
      A switch using store-and-forward transmission will receive (save) the entire packet to the buffer 
      and check it for CRC errors or other problems before sending the first bit of the packet into the outbound link. 
      Thus, store-and-forward packet switches introduce a store-and-forward delay at the input to each link along the packet's route. 
  
  - Propagation Delay :
    - In CN, propagation delay is the amount of time it takes for the head of the signal to travel from the sender to the receiver. 
    - An electromagnetic wave travelling through a medium has a propagation delay determined by the speed of light in that particular medium.
    - It can be computed as the ratio between the link length and the propagation speed over the specific medium. 
    - D_P = D / S  seconds
      - where:
        - D is the distance;
        - S is the wave propagation speed.

  - Queuing Delay
    - Time the packet spends in routing queues
    - In a packet-switched network, queuing delay is the sum of the delays encountered by a packet between the time of insertion 
      into the network and the time of delivery to the address. 
    - D_Q = 1/(μ-λ) 
      - where:
        - μ is the number of packets per second the facility can sustain
        - λ is the average rate at which packets are arriving to be serviced.
    - As a queue begins to fill up due to traffic arriving faster than it can be processed, the amount of delay a packet experiences 
      going through the queue increases. The speed at which the contents of a queue can be processed is a function of the transmission 
      rate of the facility. This leads to the classic delay curve.

  - Processing Delay
    - The time it takes routers to process the packet header.
    - During processing of a packet, routers may check for bit-level errors in the packet that occurred during transmission 
      as well as determining where the packet's next destination is.
    - Routers performing network address translation also have higher than normal processing delay 
      because those routers need to examine and modify both incoming and outgoing packets.
