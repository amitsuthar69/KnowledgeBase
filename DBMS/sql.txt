# SQL

- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to communicate with relational databases. 

- It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data, and provides commands to define database schema and manage database security.

- SELECT DISTINCT => to query unique elements from the table.

- COUNT(*) => counts all rows in a column

- ORDER BY() => Sort rows

- LENGTH(entry) => gives length
  > ORDER BY LENGTH() ASC  => sorts in asc order

- LIMIT => limits the returned row count

- UNION ALL => concatenates the results of two (or more) queries into a single result

- LOWER(LEFT(CITY, 1)) in ('sub-string') => checks if the first character is in sub-string

- RIGHT(col_name, n) extracts the "last" n characters of each col_name

- Decision making in SQL:
  > syntax:
    CASE
        WHEN condition1 THEN result1
        WHEN condition2 THEN result2
        ELSE default_result
    END

  > eg:
    SELECT name,
        CASE 
            WHEN age > 65 THEN 'Senior'
            WHEN age > 18 THEN 'Adult'
            WHEN age > 13 THEN 'Teen'
            ELSE 'Young'
        END AS age_group
    FROM people;

- END marks the end of the CASE statement (every CASE needs an END)
- AS gives a name to the new column that the CASE statement creates (means the results will show up in a new column with specified name)
 
- CONCAT('a', 'b') combines strings a and b together.

- GROUP BY col_name Groups all rows that have the same occupation together, 
  Creates a bucket for each unique occupation, 
  All rows in each bucket share the same occupation name.
