API GATEWAY

- An API gateway is a server that acts as a single entry point into a system of multiple microservices. 
- Instead of clients interacting with each service directly, they communicate through the gateway, 
  which handles several critical functions:
  - Request Routing
  - Security and Authentication
  - Logging and Monitoring
  - Protocol Transformation
  - Load Balancing
  - *Request Validation
  - *Rate limiting and Caching

- Client -> API Gateway -> Microservices
