- DP = Recusrion + Memoization

- Solves Recusrion Overlapping Problem (2 Simultaneous Recusrion Calls)

- Optimization Problems

- Identification (Similar to Recusrion)
  - Choice based question --> Recusrion --> DP > (knapsack)
  - Optimial Answer required > (maximum, minimum, largest, smallest, etc)

- Approach
  - Recusrive solution --> Memoization --> Top Down table

- Popular Problems:
  - 0-1 Knapsack (either whole or none, cannot repeat an elem)
    - Subset Sum Problem
    - Equal Sum Partition
